            <h1>EVENTS AND SHOWS</h1>
            <p>With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep 
                Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a dream, T55Rex. 
                Whether programming excites you or you feel stifled, 
                wondering how to prepare for interview questions or how to 
                ace data structures and algorithms, Yasi Tech is a 
                one-stop solution. With every tick of time, we are adding 
                arrows in our quiver. From articles on various computer 
                science subjects to programming problems for practice, 
                from basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance 
                examinations, we have been building ample content with 
                superior quality. In a short span, we have built a community
                of 1 Million+ Yasis around the world, 20,000+ Contributors 
                and 500+ Campus Ambassadors in various colleges across the 
                nation. Our success stories include a lot of students who 
                benefitted in their placements and landed jobs at tech 
                giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic network of yasin 
                and we are only a fraction of it yet.</p>
