            <p>Nina is a short range, offensive character with high speed moves and exceptional frames, who possesses
                the ability to lock down opponents with her infamous tools like sidestep 1 cancels and myriad of other +
                frame tools. Her nasty counter hits and frame traps only add to her arsenal of pressure. She has perhaps
                the steepest execution in the game concerning her advanced stuff, and while her damage isn’t exactly top
                tier, her wall carry is circumstantially the best in the game. Don’t let this scare you though, she has
                more noob friendly tactics than ever before, and she absolutely annihilates people unfamiliar with the
                matchup with pretty basic tools, as we’ll discuss later. You don’t have to be an execution god to get
                started with her, and this is the game to begin trying Nina if you haven’t already. The reward will be
                mastery of a phenomenally interesting character, as well as all the ladies. All of them. She’s easily
                the funnest characters to grind in practice mode, just landing her harder combos and setups offline is
                super fun.
                <br><br>
                Organized by chapters on the side. I’ll post a TL;DR and simplified game plan at the end, so you can
                skip to that if you have a short attention span and want to jump in immediately with her essentials. For
                most of the guide, I’ll be mixing in tactical discussion alongside movelist descriptions. Check the
                combo link below to choose some launchers and follow ups of your level, with damage value comparisons,
                as well as execution explanations at the bottom. Also covers wall enders. You’ll find how to do ws1
                combos and all the difficult stuff there. If you want to get the the meat of the fun part with this
                character check the SS1 section. I’ll put the legend for terms and inputs at the very bottom, it
                includes an explanation of the concept of frames.

            <p>Average-ish female hitbox. She is one of the 3 backsway characters in the game, so KBD the hard way if
                you want proper movement. The easy way to start chaining 2 backdashes with her (which is all you need
                till higher ranks) is to do b, b and hold the 2nd back as you roll towards db. This ensures you never
                hit d on its own making it safer and easier to avoid qcb motions. Follow this with a roll from db to
                back, then you can let go to do another back input to complete the 2nd backdash. That second part of the
                movement is what is called Korean backdash, and can be chained with itself for additional movement after
                the first regular backdash. Don’t get hung up on this if you are new, just start by using a basic back
                dash and getting a feel for movement.

            <h1 id="tactical">Tactical overview:</h1><br>
            <p>
                There are a few concepts in Tekken which are worth understanding before you embark on learning Nina.
                Some are immediately useful while others will only make more sense when you have more experience with
                the game.
                <br><br>
                The first is the concept of “gimmicks”. A simple approach might be to repeatedly do what works in till
                you win, but this can be counterproductive in the long run since it will cost you looking for alternate
                approaches to certain situations, rendering you helpless when you encounter certain obstacles and
                stunting your growth and tactical variety. For instance, moves like df32 can make Nina look a lot better
                at controlling space than she actually is, because you wont expect a move like that to be vulnerable to
                duck on the second hit. Nobody can react that fast right? Wrong. It will consistently be ducked by good
                opponents. What rank before this is actually a concern? Probably towards the end of intermediate ranks,
                since it requires a mix of reasonable reactions and character matchup knowledge.
                <br><br>
                So how do you know whether you should be using a potentially dangerous move or not? Its up to you. But
                something that will save you a lot of pain with characters like Nina is keeping in mind the
                vulnerability to moves you otherwise take for granted. By all means, use whatever works to kill scrubs,
                but you should at least attempt to seek out more air-tight ways of poking with her and constantly
                revising your move usage. People don't often mention this about Nina but her movelist is positively
                massive with very few obvious moves that are objectively amazing, so it can be tough to decide what to
                pull out on a whim. You need a good deal of planning and real time decision making to make Nina truly
                shine, she is far from a brainless rush down caricature most noobs paint her as.
                <br><br>
                When I mention scrub killers and easy moves I'll caveat them in the following sections. But keep in mind
                that if you want to maximize her against solid opponents you need to rely on less attacking, more safe
                decision making, better movement and spacing, as well as a good deal of character matchup knowledge.
                Don't get sucked in by these moves but feel free to use them to get free points against bad opponents,
                especially online. Check the TLDR strats for more.

            <h1 id="special">Special Step and SS1 Pressure:</h1><br>
            <p>
                SS1, as well as her accompanying roll dash are intricate tools that will give you great wall pressure,
                as well as a plethora of frame traps and pressure transitions. I will go through it in order but all of
                this is works together. This gets very interesting once you understand how everything works.
                Nina’s Stances/SS1 Overview:
                <br><br>Nina has a couple of unique and discrete stances she can access. Firstly, if you do a quarter circle
                forward (QCF), she has access to moves like qcf1, qcf2, qcf3, qcf423, and her qcf 1+2 / 3+4 throws. In
                season 3 you can even buffer her df,df1 grab as well. What the game doesn’t tell you, is that if you do
                do a qcf and release the forward input, you get a shortcut to her 'while standing' moves (the moves you
                get in the brief window as you recover to standing from crouch). This means you can do qcf, let go of
                forward (or hit a different input, like uf), and hit 1, to get her WS1 for instance. This is also useful
                for combos, as mentioned in the combo thread link.
                She also has a qcb (quarter circle back) stance called hayashida step. This makes her duck highs and
                automatically block lows (if you aren’t attacking), and gain access to a few moves like qcb 4 and qcb
                3+4 grab. What’s interesting about this stance is that you can cancel it with basically any move. You
                can cancel hayashida step with side step upwards, to allow a fast transition to other moves, since doing
                some moves out of qcb too quickly will get you ws moves. You also have access to moves with u, uf or ub
                without having to crouch cancel with step.
                Where SS1 fits in:
                <br><br>Side stepping is done by tapping and releasing a single up or down input (holding will make you jump or
                crouch instead and double tap gets you a side walk) and hitting 1 to get a ss1. On its own, ss1 gives
                terrible frames, but you’ll notice if you hold forward or back afterwards, she’ll do a shift in that
                direction following the ss1. This is allowing her to access her qcf and qcb stances automatically with
                close to 10 frames of advantage. Yes, you can even do the WS move tricks by doing ss1~forward, releasing
                the f to get stuff like ws1. And yes, you can do the hayashida back cancel out of ss1 to access ws moves
                as well as cancel possibility into her whole movelist (which is a visually super-fast transition if you
                do it well).
                <br><br>It gets crazier though. There are moves which allow a side step transition for ss1’s to occur. They are
                12, df12, and df32. There are also moves which can cancel the last hit into SS, they are uf434, b222,
                d41 and df31. All these transitions allow for an easy side step 1 transition, which in turn allows
                cancels, which in turn allows more moves which can potentially cancel into ss1.
                If your opponent can’t react to uf434, it is by far the best transition since you will land the fast low
                hit that makes ss1 uninterruptible. Obviously at higher levels this move falls off due to the opponent’s
                reaction speed and ability to low parry. Your alternatives then really become manual ss1 and 12 ss1.
                Df32 ss gives an ok transition with neutral frame differential on block, which allows ss1 to beat some
                things, but not jabs or df1’s, and at high level this move will be ducked, rending it pretty moot
                (however you will use this transition in combos). Your opponent cannot react with much margin though,
                and even jabs can be snuffed if the retaliation is late or slow. This is added to the fact that you are
                sidestepping, which means more linear retaliations have a chance of whiffing. Also, SS4 beats jabs,
                which means you need a pretty immediate df1 to beat both options. The 12 jabs into SS give you a -1
                frame difference on block, but because they are so much faster than df32 as a move, your opponent has
                less time to realize what you are going for, even though technically the transition is 1 frame worse.
                You can mix it up with single jab, single jab, pair of jabs SS and stuff like that to mask it further.
                Df12, b222 are obvious transitions with poor-ish frames, and d41 is fast move to transition with but
                with god awful frames (like -5). Last one really depends on whether your opponent is the type to freeze
                or retaliate if they get clipped by a low. Her transitions and frames to SS are much worse than the
                frames ss1 actually gives you post block. Therefore, do not hesitate to simply ss1 by sidestepping
                without a move transition, this works perfectly well and doesn’t require anything clever. You need to be
                close though, so this is a favorite at the wall. You can also do a qcf stance out of df32 or df12,
                although the frames are less than stellar on block.
                <br><br>If your opponent gets too good at breaking the move-based SS transitions with jabs, use other options
                out of side step. She has SS4, which ducks jabs and will make your opponent more hesitant, while
                providing a low CH combo starter, or + frames on normal hit. If you force the use of an i13 mid it’s
                more likely they will be a frame or two late vs 12 ss, and ss1 can beat them. At high level you’ll
                probably use manual side step 1’s without move transitions pretty frequently. One alternative is to do
                12 or df12 into side step transition, and simply block out of the side step instead of doing a move, and
                only do something like SS1 if you notice the string landed on hit. You aren’t obligated to attack out of
                side step, you can safely block instead.
                SS1 Special Conditions:
                <br><br>So what’s the catch? Aside from the quick thinking and crisp directional execution you need to do this,
                ss1 puts out a decent amount of push back on block. This means not every move connects conveniently on
                your opponent after a few moves, and most of the moves aside from uf434 that can side step transition
                don’t bring Nina very far forward. This means you have a more limited moveset against an opponent
                backing up and can’t loop a bunch of ss1 into their guard - you have to decide on a move mixup or two
                and you’re done unless you can incorporate range creatively. However, with the wall stopping your
                opponent from getting pushed back, the possibilities explode and you can throw a perpetual wall of pain
                that is tough to defend against, striking out with lows, mids and highs out of nowhere. Also, the only
                guaranteed followups from ss1 happen at the wall when you land a ss1 off axis from your opponent and
                chain into b~uf3 or f~qcf1.
                SS1 Application:
                <br><br>On open ground, ss1 has a few applications. You can do ss1b~ss1 loops for a pseudo-keepout to intimidate
                opponents at range, or you can use it to mask certain attacks. For instance, you can do ss1f~3 from far
                to get a hidden qcf3 startup to approach the opponent. For this the ss1 doesn’t have to be in range of
                the opponent. Similarly, you can do ss1b~uf1 to get people to move in response to a perceived whiff,
                only to get clipped by her long range orbital. You also have ss1b~uf4 which can close the gap without
                committing to rest of the string. ss1f~1 for qcf1 always connects even with ss1’s pushback, but in turn
                the +1 on block is difficult to capitalize on because of the pushback the qcf1 creates. It does catch
                eager retaliations and is pretty impossible to interrupt, but qcf1 is a high so you can still duck it or
                beat it with a high crush. A ss1 canceled into side step leaves you with f2, db3 and d2 still in range,
                which is ok for pressing too.
