# High-School-Projects (Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

From 2015 to 2018, I had a strong interest in designing and coding websites. I began my journey using pure HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to create applications from scratch. Although these early projects were nothing special, they show how far I have come since my initial development days. During my high school years, I also explored Bootstrap and more advanced JavaScript, with my projects available in various repositories.
